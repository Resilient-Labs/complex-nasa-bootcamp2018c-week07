How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, es6 JS

I had to think critically about how I wanted to structure my first complex api request so for the sake of simplicity I did not make it OOP. I wanted to see if I could first get the apis to work together so I opted to nest them in each other.

Optimizations (in the future): 
-Make project OOP
-get rid of nested fecth request and create methods to call each one
